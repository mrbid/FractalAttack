# FractalAttack [WIP]
A little game where you must stop fractal asteroids destroying a planet.

I'm not going to finish this, this project is abandoned, you can crash into the planet or just watch the Menger Sponge comets hit it.

If this version does not run smoothly you will have to try the [Initial Release here](https://github.com/mrbid/FractalAttack/tree/InitialRelease) which has no comets. There is also a web version of the initial release [here](https://mrbid.github.io/eris/).
